      I am currently a Computer Science major, I love to read, and go on hikes.
      I enjoy watching movies and playing video games with friends as well. I am
      married, my wife and I got married April 12th of this year.

      I have always enjoyed the idea of creating things on computers, and when I
      was a kid I toyed around with developing websites, but never really got
      anywhere with it. My favorite scripture is in Mosiah 3:19 because it
      always reminds me to resist temptation. I love the professors here at
      Byu-Idaho, and I am learning so much from my time here.
